# Glassmorphism-card

Created this project to demonstrate my knowledge using box drop filters to create a 3D like card which can serve for many purposes. For this project I gave it a purpose of displaying "Team Members" of a company. I also used my knowledge of absolute positioning and transitions to position items and create a hover effect for Social Media icons.

This project continues my CSS and HTML review. I cane across this idea when viewing a similar webpage.
